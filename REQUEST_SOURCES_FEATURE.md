# 📧 Request Sources Analytics - Feature Summary

## ✨ What's New

I've added comprehensive **Request Sources Analytics** to track who's sending emails and measure team performance!

### 🎯 New Features

#### 1. **Sender Tracking** 
- Every email now captures the sender's email address
- Automatically logged in the CSV for historical analysis

#### 2. **Request Sources Dashboard Section**
Located after the 7-Day Trend, before Individual Staff KPIs:

**📊 Top Request Sources (All Time)**
- Horizontal bar chart showing top 10 email senders
- Total request count per sender
- Helps identify high-volume requesters

**📈 Request Volume by Source (Today)**
- Beautiful donut chart showing today's distribution
- Color-coded by sender
- Quick visual of today's workload sources

**⏱️ Response Time Patterns**
- Total completed requests metric
- Average response time (estimated)
- Completion rate percentage
- Today's completion stats

**📋 Sender Details Table**
- Complete list of all senders
- Total requests per sender
- First request timestamp
- Last request timestamp
- Sortable and exportable

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**Modified Files:**
1. **`distributor.py`**
   - Updated `append_stats()` to accept sender parameter
   - Now logs sender email for every request
   - CSV header includes new "Sender" column

2. **`dashboard.py`**
   - New "Request Sources Analytics" section
   - Multiple visualizations (bar chart, pie chart, metrics)
   - Sender summary table with timestamps
   - Backward compatible (works with old data that doesn't have sender info)

### 📝 CSV Format Update

**Old Format:**
```
Date,Time,Subject,Assigned To
```

**New Format:**
```
Date,Time,Subject,Assigned To,Sender
```

### 🚀 How It Works

1. **When email arrives** → System captures sender's email address
2. **Assigns to staff** → Logs: date, time, subject, assignee, **sender**
3. **Dashboard reads CSV** → Analyzes sender patterns
4. **Shows analytics** → Who sends most, when, response times

### ⚠️ Important Notes

**For Existing Data:**
- Old CSV entries won't have sender info (that's OK!)
- Dashboard handles this gracefully
- Only future requests will show in sender analytics

**To Start Tracking:**
- ✅ Dashboard is already updated (restart complete)
- ⚠️ **Distributor service needs restart** to start capturing senders
- After service processes next email, sender data will appear

### 🎯 What Your Manager Can Now See

**Questions Answered:**
1. ✅ **Who sends us the most requests?**
2. ✅ **Which sources are most active today?**
3. ✅ **What's our completion rate?**
4. ✅ **When did we first/last hear from a sender?**
5. ✅ **How many unique request sources do we have?**

**Business Insights:**
- Identify high-volume customers
- Spot unusual activity patterns
- Measure team response efficiency
- Plan resource allocation based on demand sources

### 📊 Example Metrics
