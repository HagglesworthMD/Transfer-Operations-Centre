## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-11 🏥 Clinical Safety Release

### 🚨 NEW: Risk-Aware Urgent Filter

**The Problem:** Critical requests (deletions, STAT cases) were being treated the same as routine transfers.

**The Solution:** Semantic risk detection with SLA enforcement.

#### Urgent Filter Workflow:
```
INCOMING EMAIL
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  SEMANTIC RISK CHECK    │
│  • Contains "delete"?   │
│  • Contains "patient"?  │
│  • Marked URGENT?       │
└─────────────────────────┘
      │
      ├── CRITICAL ──▶ 🚨 20-min SLA timer starts
      │                   └── If breached: Re-assign + Escalate to Manager
      │
      ├── URGENT ────▶ ⚠️ Flagged in dashboard
      │
      └── NORMAL ────▶ ✅ Standard round-robin
```

#### Risk Detection Rules:
| Condition | Risk Level |
|-----------|------------|
| Action + Context (e.g., "delete patient scan") | 🚨 CRITICAL |
| Urgency + Action (e.g., "STAT delete") | 🚨 CRITICAL |
| Outlook High Importance Flag | 🚨 CRITICAL |
| Urgency word alone (e.g., "ASAP") | ⚠️ URGENT |
| Normal request | ✅ NORMAL |

#### New Dashboard: Clinical Control Tower
- **Green Banner:** System Normal - no urgent tickets
- **Yellow Banner:** Active risks being monitored
- **Red Banner:** SLA BREACH - ticket exceeded 20 minutes!

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-10 🛡️ Smart Filter

### Fixed: Single Point of Failure
**Problem:** Staff emails were blindly archived, losing tickets when staff logged their own issues.

**Solution:** Smart Filter only archives if:
- Sender IS in staff.txt AND
- Subject starts with "RE:", "Accepted:", "Declined:" OR contains "[Assigned:"

Staff sending NEW emails are now treated as customers!

## How Metrics Are Calculated

### Response Time Tracking:
```
1. EMAIL ARRIVES
   └── System logs: [Assigned: staff@] + TIMESTAMP
   
2. STAFF REPLIES (CC's shared inbox)
   └── System logs: [COMPLETED: staff@] + TIMESTAMP
   
3. DASHBOARD CALCULATES
   └── Response Time = COMPLETED timestamp - ASSIGNED timestamp
   └── Completion Rate = COMPLETED count / ASSIGNED count × 100
```

### The CSV Contains:
```csv
Date,Time,Subject,Assigned To,Sender,Risk Level
2025-12-11,08:30:00,[Assigned: chuck.norris@...],chuck.norris@sa.gov.au,sender@...,normal
2025-12-11,09:15:00,[COMPLETED: chuck.norris@...],completed,chuck.norris@sa.gov.au,normal
```
